* Introduction

  Cannon is a simple command launcher that mimics
  Dmenu application.

* Motivation

  Just missing a simple app launcher on Emacs that has no
  =helm= or =ivy= dependencies. The name is a joke about launching
  =chrome= web browser inside Emacs/Exwm, a heavily metal ball
  witch causes nightmares.

* Demo

  #+CAPTION: cannon
  #+NAME:   fig:cannon prompt

  [[./assets/cannon.jpg]]

* Dependencies

  - cl-lib
  - comint
  - seq

* Tested on

  - Emacs >= 26.3

* Installation
** Cask

   Add =Cannon= git repository to the ~Cask~ file:

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

   (depends-on "cannon"
               :git "https://github.com/esac-io/cannon")

   #+END_SRC

   Run =cask install= command.

** Manually

   Clone =Cannon= repository to a arbitrary location:

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh

   $ git clone https://github.com/esac-io/cannon ~/.emacs.d/site-elisp/cannon

   #+END_SRC

   Add =Cannon= directory to =load-path= in your Emacs
   initialization file (~init.el~) and load it.

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

   ;; add to load-path
   (add-to-list 'load-path "/replace/me/to/cannon/path")

   ;; load cannon feature
   (require 'cannon nil t)

   #+END_SRC

   - Note: For a more dynamic approach uses:
     - =M-x load-file RET=
     - =M-x load-library RET cannon RET=

* Usage

  =M-x cannon RET=, select a executable in the prompt launch it =RET=.

  - Note: it's recommend to bind =cannon= function to a keybind of
    choice (mine: =C-x C-l=).

* Customize

  =M-x customize-group RET cannon=
