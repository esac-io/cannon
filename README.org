* Introduction

  Cannon is a simple command launcher written in pure
  =Elisp=. It mimics the beloved =Dmenu= and targets =Emacs=
  aficionados that have no desired to leave their favorite
  interpreter.

  If you use =Exwm=, i.e., =Emacs= as also your =Xorg Window Manager=
  this package will be a good choice to launch =X11= applications,
  like: =mpv=, =mupdf=, =chromium=, empowering the user experience.

  Going into detail, Cannon is a simple lightweight application
  launcher that has no outside dependencies (we rely on the
  =completing-read= built-in =C= function). If you use some
  narrowing/selecting framework, like - =helm=, =ivy=, etc - it's easy
  to use =cannon= as a candidates source. Just call/invoke the
  function =cannon-cmd-candidates= at some point inside you
  =Elisp= interface code to get the executable candidates.

  The project's name itself is a joke about launching =Chrome= web
  browser inside =Emacs/Exwm=, a heavily metal ball which causes
  nightmares.

* Demo

  #+NAME:   fig:cannon prompt

* Dependencies

  - cl-lib
  - comint
  - seq

* Tested on

  - Emacs 26.3
  - Emacs 28.0.50
  - For FreeBSD users: emacs-devel ports.

* Installation
** Manually

   Clone =Cannon= repository to an arbitrary location:

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh

   $ git clone https://github.com/esac-io/cannon ~/.emacs.d/site-elisp/cannon

   #+END_SRC

   Add =Cannon= directory to =load-path= in your
   Emacs initialization file (~init.el~) and load it.

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

   ;; add to load-path
   (add-to-list 'load-path "/replace/me/to/cannon/path")

   ;; load cannon feature
   (require 'cannon nil t)

   #+END_SRC

   - Note: For a more dynamic approach:
     - =M-x load-file RET=
     - =M-x load-library RET cannon RET=

** Compile

   * Note: Optional but recommended.

   To compile the files to the =Elisp= byte-compiled representation:

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh

   [at-cannon-root-directory]$ make

   #+END_SRC

* Usage

  =M-x cannon-launch RET=, write/select an executable in the prompt and launch it
  with =RET=.

  - Note: it's recommend to bind =cannon-launch= function to some keybind of
    choice, for quick access. (mine: =C-x C-l=).

  - Note: to enable/disable the minor mode dynamically:
    =M-x turn-on-cannon-mode RET= and =M-x turn-off-cannon-mode RET=.

  That's all! :D

* Customize

  * Note: To see all the options inside =Emacs= and customize it,
    use: =M-x customize-group RET cannon RET=.

  We have a few available options to customize some aspects of cannon,
  even though the behavior will probably stay the same. Remember: this
  package was designed having vanilla =Emacs= in mind, so if you are
  missing something, it'll be necessary to properly extend it.

- =cannon-prompt= :: String to display in the initial 'minibuffer'
  prompt (default 'Launch: ').

- =cannon-args-prompt= :: String to display in the arguments
  'minibuffer' prompt (default 'Args: ').

- =cannon-history-size= :: A number that determines how many
  recently executed commands should be recorded (default 16).

- =cannon-switch-to-buffer-flag= :: Non-nil means switch to the
  created process buffer (default true: t).

- =cannon-kill-buffer-flag= :: Non-nil means automatically kill buffer
  when process exits. (default true: t).

- =cannon-cache-file= :: Cache file path, where the generated
  (command and history) lists will be saved.
