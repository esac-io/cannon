* Introduction

  Cannon is a simple command launcher that mimics
  Dmenu application.

* Motivation

  Just missing a simple app launcher on Emacs that has no
  =helm= or =ivy= dependencies. The name is a joke about launching
  =chrome= web browser inside Emacs/Exwm, a heavily metal ball
  witch causes nightmares.

  - Emacs >= 26.3

* Installation
** Cask

   Add =rfc-docs= git repository to the Cask file:

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

   (depends-on "cannon"
               :git "https://github.com/esac-io/cannon")

   #+END_SRC

   And run cask Install command:

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh

   $ cask install

   #+END_SRC

** Manually

   =~/.emacs.d/site-lisp/cannon=.

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh

   $ git clone https://github.com/esac-io/cannon ~/.emacs.d/site-elisp/cannon

   #+END_SRC

* Configure
** Enables

   Add the following snippet of code to you Emacs initialization file
   (usually ~init.el~).

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

   ;; require cannon feature (load it)
   (require 'cannon nil t)

   #+END_SRC

   Note: For a more dynamic approach uses =load-file= or
         =load-library= functions, i.e, =M-x load-library RET cannon RET=.

** Customize

   Use emacs customize interface to see what options/values
   are available =M-x customize-group RET cannon=.

* Usage

  to bind this function to some keybind of choice.
